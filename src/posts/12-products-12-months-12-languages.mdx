On September 1st, 2019 I will begin a 12 month challenge to launch 12 different products, and because I want to expand my
skills as a developer I will write them in 12 different languages. I compiled a list of languages that I've wanted to try out below.
I included "no code" because I really want to see what the [hype](https://medium.com/@rrhoover/the-rise-of-no-code-e733d7c0944d) is all about.

1. Javascript
1. Python
1. Swift
1. TypeScript
1. Go
1. Dart
1. C#
1. Clojure
1. Rust
1. ClojureScript
1. Ruby
1. [No Code](https://www.makerpad.co/#)

Now here is each product's acceptance criteria 🎯:

* 👨‍💻 The majority of the product is written using one of the languages above.

* 🥳😽 Launch on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/).

And that's it really!! The hard part is figuring out what to build and learning the language! I'll be posting monthly as I 
launch every product and I'll likely open-source everything. I'm really looking forward to expanding my skills in product, marketing and development [🦹‍♂️].
